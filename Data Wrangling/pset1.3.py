"""
Let's assume that you combined the code from the previous 2 exercises with code
from the lesson on how to build requests, and downloaded all the data locally.
The files are in a directory "data", named after the carrier and airport:
"{}-{}.html".format(carrier, airport), for example "FL-ATL.html".

The table with flight info has a table class="dataTDRight". Your task is to
extract the flight data from that table as a list of dictionaries, each
dictionary containing relevant data from the file and table row. This is an
example of the data structure you should return:

data = [{"courier": "FL",
         "airport": "ATL",
         "year": 2012,
         "month": 12,
         "flights": {"domestic": 100,
                     "international": 100}
        },
         {"courier": "..."}
]

Note - year, month, and the flight data should be integers.
You should skip the rows that contain the TOTAL data for a year.

There are couple of helper functions to deal with the data files.
Please do not change them for grading purposes.
All your changes should be in the 'process_file' function.
